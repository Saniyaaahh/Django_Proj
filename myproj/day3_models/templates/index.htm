<h1 class="firstHeading">Full Stack Web Development with Python and Django:   
</h1>
<p>The 10-day immersive course on Full Stack Web Development with Python and Django provides a hands-on learning experience to students seeking to master the art of creating sophisticated Web applications utilizing the powerful Django framework. The course curriculum encompasses the fundamental concepts of constructing basic applications using the MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern, along with advanced topics such as administration, session management, authentication, and automated testing. This exhaustive program is designed to offer a comprehensive and practical understanding of the programming language, rather than a mere academic overview of syntax and grammar.

<h1>What is Django?</h1>
<p>Django is a high-level, open-source web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is written in Python and designed to help developers build web applications quickly and easily. Django includes a number of built-in features and tools that make web development less time-consuming and more efficient.
</p>
<p>One of the key features of Django is its ability to handle database management seamlessly. Django uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), which allows developers to interact with databases using Python classes and objects. This makes it easier for developers to manage database operations and maintain the consistency of data.</p>
<p>Django also includes a powerful URL routing system, which allows developers to map URLs to views. Views are functions that receive HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. This enables developers to create dynamic web pages and serve them to users based on their requests.</p>

<p>Another key feature of Django is its robust security system. Django has built-in protection against various security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. This helps developers to build secure web applications with less effort.</p>
<p>In summary, Django is a powerful and versatile web framework that simplifies web development by providing built-in features for database management, URL routing, security, and scalability. Its popularity and active community make it an excellent choice for building web applications of all sizes and complexities.

<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has gained widespread popularity among developers over the years. Created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, Python was designed to be easy to learn and read, with a syntax that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. It is an open-source language, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of Python is its simplicity. Python code is easy to read and understand, even for beginners. This is due in part to its use of whitespace indentation, which helps to create code that is well-structured and easy to follow. Python also has a vast standard library, which provides a wide range of modules and functions that can be used to perform common tasks, such as reading and writing files, handling data, and working with network protocols.</p>

<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. It is based on the idea that machines can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on that data.</p>
<p>There are several different types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where each data point is assigned a specific label or category. The algorithm then uses this labeled data to make predictions or decisions about new, unlabeled data. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and it must identify patterns and group data into clusters based on similarities. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</p>
